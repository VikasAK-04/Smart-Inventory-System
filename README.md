A comprehensive full-stack IoT and software solution designed for **real-time tracking and intelligent management of tomato crates**. This project leverages **ESP32** microcontrollers, **RFID** technology, and **OLED** displays for data acquisition, a robust **Spring Boot** backend with **PostgreSQL** for data handling, and a dynamic **JSP web dashboard** featuring interactive maps powered by **Leaflet.js** for intuitive visualization.

This system aims to revolutionize traditional inventory practices by providing accurate, real-time data, significantly reducing spoilage, and enhancing transparency across the supply chain for intermediaries, warehouses, and farmers.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Individual Crate Tracking:** Utilize unique RFID tags for precise identification and tracking of each tomato crate.
* **Real-time Data Acquisition:** ESP32 microcontrollers read RFID data and transmit it to the backend instantly via HTTP over Wi-Fi.
* **On-Device Feedback:** Integrated OLED screens on ESP32 devices display scanned tag information in real-time, providing immediate confirmation.
* **Dynamic Web Dashboard:** A JSP-based web interface offers a centralized view of all crate locations, freshness status, and critical alerts.
* **Automated Spoilage Detection:** Intelligent algorithms automatically detect and flag expired tomato crates based on harvest timestamps and predefined shelf-life criteria.
* **Robust Data Management:** PostgreSQL database ensures reliable, scalable, and secure storage for all inventory data.
* **API Integration:** RESTful APIs facilitate seamless integration with other logistics, ERP, or supply chain management systems.
* **Clean Architecture:** Built with a maintainable MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for the Spring Boot backend.
