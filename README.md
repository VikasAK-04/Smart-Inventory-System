# 🍅 Smart Tomato Inventory System

A full-stack IoT and software solution for **real-time tracking of tomato crates** using **ESP32**, **RFID**, and **OLED**, with a backend built on **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**, and a dynamic **thymeleaf web dashboard** featuring interactive maps powered by **Leaflet.js**.

This project enhances tomato inventory visibility, reduces spoilage, and empowers intermediaries who takes tomatoes from Farmer in bulk  and Transport to the different location by taking real-time data from ESP32 and RFID 



##  Key Features

-  **RFID-Based Tracking** of individual tomato crates.
-  **ESP32** reads RFID tags and sends data over WiFi to the backend.
-  **OLED Display** shows scanned crate info instantly.
-  **JSP Web Dashboard** with Leaflet.js for real-time crate monitoring.
-  Automatic detection of **expired crates** using timestamps.
-  Backend built using **Spring Boot** with clean MVC architecture.
-  **PostgreSQL** for efficient and scalable data storage.
-  **REST APIs** for system integration and scalability.

##  Technology Stack

| Layer            | Tools & Frameworks                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | JSP, HTML, CSS, Leaflet.js               |
| Backend          | Spring Boot, REST APIs                   |
| Database         | PostgreSQL                               |
| Microcontroller  | ESP32                                    |
| Sensors/Modules  | MFRC522 RFID Reader, OLED SSD1306        |
| Libraries (ESP32)| WiFi, HTTPClient, MFRC522, Adafruit GFX  |

##  How It Works

1.  ESP32 scans an RFID tag using the **MFRC522 Reader**.
2.  The **OLED display** shows the tag UID immediately.
3.  ESP32 sends the tag data to a **Spring Boot REST API** via HTTP POST.
4.  The backend stores data with **timestamps** in PostgreSQL.
5.  The **dashboard** updates in real time, showing crate status, age, and location.

## 🔗 REST API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint      | Description                        |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/addTag`      | Accept tag data from ESP32         |
| GET    | `/expired`     | List of expired tomato crates      |
| GET    | `/dashboard`   | Loads the web-based dashboard      |
